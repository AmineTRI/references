Java Core :
Java is not 100% object (or pure object) since it features primitf types such as int or char or byte.
Java is strongly typed, no automatic cocnversion, casts are used instead (or static methods such as Integr.getIneger(String i)).
toString method can be overriden to represent and object when print is called.
Java evolves through JSR (Java specification requests) coming from the JCP (Java Comunity Process).













Inheritance :
An interface can extend multiple interfaces.
